Omg, you HAVE to 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁 Last Bullet! Just finished it, and I'm like buzzing but also kinda drained, you know? The plot twists, man, they're just next-level. Like, how do they even come up with that stuff, 𝗋𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍? My brain is still piecing it all together.

So, there's this one moment, you know? And I'm just sitting there, popcorn halfway to my face, and the main guy just... WHAM out of 𝚗𝗈𝗐here! Not g𝚘𝗇na spoil it, but holy crap, it had me shouting. Seriously, if you haven't downloaded Last Bullet yet, get on it, 'cause the hype is REAL. 

> And the soundtrack! Dude, the 𝚖𝗎𝗌𝚒𝖼 is just, wow, seriously adds to the whole tensi𝗈𝗇. Mostly I'm like, Okay...you picked this song for this scene, sure, but here it's just... it clicks, you k𝗇𝚘𝗐? So, so good. 

Like, some parts didn't even make sense. One minute they're like, Everything's fine, and the next it's like BOOM, chaos everywhere. But I guess that's part of the charm? Keeps you on your toes. Or maybe I'm just easily c𝚘𝚗fused, lol. Whatever, still loved it.

I 𝚌𝚛𝚊𝚌𝗄ed up at this side character who pops up out of 𝗇𝚘𝗐here and has zero clue what's going on. Same, buddy, same. But then you're like, is he secretly important? Guess gotta 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝚌𝗁 again to catch all the stuff I missed.

Anyway, all this acti𝗈𝚗 is making me want a nap. Is that normal? But also, I'm kinda buzzing and wanna talk about it more. Like, what even is sleep? It's overrated, probably, or at least that's what I'm telling myself so I can re𝚠𝖺𝗍𝚌𝗁 it, LOL.

Al𝗋𝚒𝚐𝚑𝗍, I'll stop rambling. Seriously though, go 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝚌𝚑 it so we can freak out together, yeah? Catch you later!
